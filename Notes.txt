Two days back, I wanted to create a framework/template code for running simulations
of Multi-Armed-Bandits (MAB) algorithms, and started this Python project for that purpose.

August 6th.
    - First basic version is done.
    - Ran UCB1 algo and plotted the empirical regret and theoretical bounds. Things work well.

    - I have to replace lists with numpy arrays for cleaner code and better perf.
