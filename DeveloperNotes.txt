Two days back, I wanted to create a framework/template code for running simulations
of Multi-Armed-Bandits (MAB) algorithms, and started this Python project for that purpose.

August 6th.
    - First basic version is done.
    - Ran UCB1 algo and plotted the empirical regret and theoretical bounds. Things work well.

August 9th
    - Using numpy arrays instead of lists
    - Implememnted UCB-Incremental and UCB-Doubling algorithms

    - Sometimes, regret seems to be going down considerably with time. Is there any bug in the algo?

August 10th
    - Added UCB-Doubling-TR (Tighter Radius) algorithm.
    - Added a experiment runner, to run MAB algorithms multiple times to get 'average' regret.
    - Refactored the usage of a list of algorithms. Greatly improves code control.
